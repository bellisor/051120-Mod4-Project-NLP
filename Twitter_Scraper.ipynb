      "1286357600133677057 2020-07-23 13:48:45 EDT <JasonDarkX2> Halo Infinite is taking Halo into open world? Wondering how speed running levels would work.  Ooh could imagine  so many exploits/stunts with the new grappling hook though. Gonna be looking foward to some multiplayer gameplay #HaloInfinite #Halo #Xbox https://youtu.be/HZtc5-syeAk¬†\n",

Because man, does this franchise deserve a good game again. Halo really needs this. #HaloInfinite #XboxGamesShowcase\n",
      "1286357598132998145 2020-07-23 13:48:45 EDT <PSO214011687> 80% of the halo community wanted no sprint because it ruined gameplay.  Not only is sprint still in the game, they added a grapple gun.  They flunked hard. No thanks I‚Äôll pass on #HaloInfinite.  Only other games I liked was the pso2 expansion and fable. Rough start #Xbox\n",
      "1286357576595144709 2020-07-23 13:48:40 EDT <PTibz> It is in fact open world Halo! I'm stoked on that and the art style seems to have gone back to more simplistic shapes and bold colors which I'm also a big fan of in things I play. #HaloInfinite\n",
